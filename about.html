    <p>Hey, my name is Love Atkinson and I am a co-founder of this website. I am 15 years old going into my junior year of high school in East Hartford, Ct. I grew up and lived in Hartford, Ct with my mom and brother. I just started going natural July 28, 2018.</p>
    <p>My wash day routine is to wet my hair then shampoo it with a handful of argan oil of morocco. I would massage it into my hair with the pads of my fingers. Once I feel like it has been evenly distributed I would wash that out and get another handful of the shampoo and repeat that step. Once Ive completed that Id get the right amount of conditioner to put in my hair and for me I would preferably use argan oil of morocco. I would spread it out evenly in my hair then I would use a scalp massage brush to thoroughly distribute the products through my hair. After doing that for about 5 minutes I would wash it all out. Then I would get a handful of argan oil intensive conditioning treatment, spread in my hair, and leave it in for 15 minutes with a cap over my head as I would finish taking a shower. Once Im done with the shower I will get dressed and go under the hooded dryer with the cap and deep conditioner still in my hair. I would stay under the dryer for 30 minutes. After thats done Id comb out my hair with my wide tooth comb from ends to roots. Then Id go to the sink and wash it all out. Once its all out I would air dry my hair for about 10 minutes. Then Id put leave in conditioner and oil in my hair to keep it moisturized for the next day. Finally Id but on my bonnet and go to bed. I know its a lot but its all worth it in the end. You will be really happy with the end results.</p>

    <p>I am a 16 year old high school student in Stamford, Connecticut. I live with my Mom, Dad, two older sisters, and my younger brother, and I am the co-creator of IN & OUT.</p>
    <p>For my wash day routine the first thing I do is take my hair out of its previous style. Then I part it into four sections and detangle with a wide tooth comb. I start my music, get in the shower, and wet my hair. I then would take out one section and lather the shampoo into my scalp with the pads of my fingers. Then I switch to my massage brush and after awhile Id rinse it out and repeat that step with the other three sections. After Ive done that with each sections I would apply it from root to ends and finger detangle my hair. Then switch to a wide tooth comb and a denman brush for the ends of my hair. I leave the conditioner in for 3-5 minutes, and then wash it out with my hair still in sections. I put my deep conditioner in my hair then place a shopping bag and heated cap on my hair. After an hour I washed it out. While my hair is still wet I do the L.O.C. method with leave in conditioner, oils and cream. Usually Id twist or braid my hair or I would go straight into styling.</p>
